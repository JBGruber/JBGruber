### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Post-Doc Researcher at the  Department of Communication Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the [OPTED project](https://opted.eu/team/wp7-pre-processing-storage-and-data-sharing/johannes-b-gruber/) with a focus on text as data methods and creating open source software tools to make these methods easily accessible and reproducible.
Previously, I worked as Post-Doc Researche at the Chair for Digital Democracy at the European New School of Digital Studies (ENS), European University Viadrina Foundation Frankfurt (Oder).
In 2021, I passed my PhD in Politics at the University of Glasgow.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several R packages, the AmCAT suite of packages, research about hybrid media systems and computational methods
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning :snake: Python, some React and :penguin: Linux stuff
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R, text analysis and political communication
